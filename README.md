## Hi there :sunglasses:

- Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, C#, GitHub, Git, VS Code and Visual Studio 2022.
- I am City & Guilds certified in C (L1 & L2) and C++ (trained on Borland Turbo C++, way back in the 1990's).
- I grew up in the 1970's/1980's and have owned at least one computer since 1982. 
- I enjoy solving complex problems in elegant ways, usually slowly and thoroughly.
- I like these emojis and suspect some of them might come in useful...
